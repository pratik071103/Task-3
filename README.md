# Task-3

I successfully imported the dataset into Microsoft SQL Server and employed SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) 
to facilitate the importing of flat files through the intuitive Import Wizard tool. During the exploratory data analysis (EDA) 
phase, we delved deep into the data to uncover valuable insights pertaining to the operations of the Olist Brazilian e-commerce 
platform. Subsequently, we meticulously crafted and fine-tuned views to establish a solid foundation for conducting in-depth
analyses.

Furthermore, we meticulously implemented indexing strategies to ensure that database queries are executed efficiently, 
thereby enhancing the overall performance of the system. By adopting these systematic approaches, we were able to gain a 
comprehensive understanding of the dataset and derive actionable recommendations to drive business decisions effectively.
